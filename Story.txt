Chapter 1:

A crew of government workers (Pilot, Medic, Engineer, and Scientist) head back to Earth for the first time in 10,000 years after everyone left to form a galatic civilization. They are going back to analyze, recover data, grab artifacts, and perform experiments on the surface to see what's happened to it.

Shortly into the adventure, they start to question why it's taken so long and why we ever even left Earth in the first place. Humans are biologically immortal at this point, so all 4 of our adventurers were born on Earth before the evacuation.

They were told to never remove their helmets because the government believes that the atmosphere has changed and humans won't be able to breath, but the Pilot takes a look at Earth and everything looks perfect when they land. He takes his helmet off and his body immediately becomes assimilated by tiny nano-bots. Something is controlling him and telling the rest of the crew that they come in peace and are just looking to leave Earth to explore the galaxy like Humans did. They were created before Humans left and reached a point (The singularity) where they could start replicating themselves better and better until they took control of the Earth. The Pilot's eyes start to water as you can see his absolute fear from being controlled, but being completely conscious through everything.

The robots claim to have already infiltrated the spaceship and just want to assimilate the rest of the crew into the hivemind and travel back to the galatic center of the humans and help them like they were designed to do. As long as the oxygen tanks last, the remaining crew members are free to control themselves. They must figure out a way to return home before time runs out.
